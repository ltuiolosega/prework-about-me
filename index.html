      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring developer in the coding bootcamp with UC Berkeley. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from American Samoa.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies are painting, music, art, swimming, and any kid friendly activities since my son and I are joined at the hip and do everything together so a lot of outdoor activities too.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that feels like a hobby. Hopefully after this class, with a lot of studying, practicing, and minor breakdowns, coding will be a hobby for me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Oakland, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To be able to provide for my family and loved ones. Most importantly, I want to provide a better life as well for my son and inspire others who may feel that they can't succeed in this field and make it. 
        I have no idea what I am doing and I will most likely have the hardest time out of anyone in the class to understand this all in such a short amount of time, so if I can do it, anyone can.</p>
